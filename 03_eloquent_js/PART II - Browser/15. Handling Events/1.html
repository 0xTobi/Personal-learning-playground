        <!-- EVENT HANDLERS -->
        <!-- //  We can actively notify our code when an event occurs. Browsers do this by allowing us to register functions as handlers 
        for specific events -->
        <p>Click this document to activate the handler.</p>
        <script>
            window.addEventListener("click", () => { console.log("You knocked?")});

            // The window binding refers to a built-in object provided by the browser. It represents the browser window that contains the document.
        </script>





        <!-- EVENT AND DOM NODES -->
        <!-- Such handler method can also be found on DOM elements and some other types of objects -->
        <!-- Event listeners are called only when the event happens in the context of the object they are registered on. -->
        <button>Click me</button> 
        <p>No handler here.</p> 

        <script> 
        let button = document.querySelector("button"); 
        button.addEventListener("click", () => { 
            console.log("Button clicked.");
        });

        //  Giving a node an onclick attribute has a similar effect. 
        //  This works for most types of events—you can attach a handler through the attribute whose name is the event name with on in front of it.
        //  But a node can have only one onclick attribute, so you can register only one handler per node that way.
        //  addEventListener method allows us to add any number of handlers.
        //  The removeEventListener method, called with arguments similar to addEventListener, removes a handler.
        </script>


        <!-- removeEventListener -->
        <button id="button2">Act-once button</button> 
        <script>
            let button2 = document.querySelector(" #button2 ");

            function once() {
                console.log("Done.")
                button2.removeEventListener("click", once)
            }

            button2.addEventListener("click", once)

        </script>





        <!-- EVENT OBJECTS -->
        <!-- event handler functions are passed an argument: the event object. This object holds additional information about the event. -->
        <!-- The object’s type property always holds a string identifying the event (such as "click" or "mousedown"). -->
        <button id="button3" style="display: block;margin-top: 2em;">Click me any way you want</button> 

        <script> 
        let button3 = document.querySelector(" #button3 "); 
        button3.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
            if (event.button == 0) { 
                console.log("Left button");
            } else if (event.button == 1) { 
                console.log("Middle button");
            } else if (event.button == 2) { 
                console.log("Right button");
            }
        });

        </script>





        <!-- PROPAGATION -->
        <!-- Handler registered on nodes with children will also receive events that happens in the children-->
        <!-- But if both the paragraph and the button have a handler, the more specific handler—the one on the button—gets to go first. -->
        <!-- The event is said to PROPAGATE outward, from the node where it happened to that node’s parent node and on to the root of the document. -->
        <!-- Finally, after all handlers registered on a specific node have had their turn, handlers registered on the whole window get a chance to respond to the event. -->
        <!-- At any point, an event handler can call the stopPropagation method on the event object to prevent handlers further up from receiving the event. -->
        <!-- This can be useful when, for example, you have a button inside another clickable element and you don’t want clicks on the button to activate the outer element’s click behavior. -->

        <p id="p4">A paragraph with a <button id="button4">button</button>.</p> 
        
        <script> 
        let para4 = document.querySelector(" #p4 "); 
        let button4 = document.querySelector(" #button4 "); 

        para4.addEventListener("mousedown", () => { 
            console.log("Handler for paragraph.");
        });

        button4.addEventListener("mousedown", event => { 
            console.log("Handler for button."); 
            if (event.button == 2) event.stopPropagation();
        });
        </script>


        <!-- Most event objects have a target property that refers to the node where they originated.  -->
        <!-- It is also possible to use the target property to cast a wide net for a specific type of event. -->
        <div id="buttons">
            <button>A</button> 
            <button>B</button> 
            <button>C</button> 
        </div>
        <a href="google.com" target="_blank">google</a>
        
        <script>
            document.querySelector(" #buttons ").addEventListener("click", event => { 
                if (event.target.nodeName == "BUTTON") { 
                    console.log("Clicked", event.target.textContent);
                } 
            });
        </script>





        <!-- DEFAULT ACTIONS -->
        <!-- Many events have a default action associated with them. -->
        <!-- For most types of events, the JavaScript event handlers are called before the default behavior takes place. -->
        <!-- If the handler doesn’t want this normal behavior to happen typically because it has already taken care of handling the event, it can call the preventDefault method on the event object. -->

        <!-- A link that cannot be followed: -->
        <div id="mozilla">
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" style="display: block; margin-top: 2em;">MDN</a> 
        </div>  
        
        <script> let link = document.querySelector(" #mozilla").querySelector("a"); 
        link.addEventListener("click", event => { 
            console.log("Nope."); event.preventDefault();
        });
        </script>

        <!-- Try not to do such things unless you have a really good reason to. It’ll be unpleasant for people who use your page when expected behavior is broken. -->





        <!-- KEY EVENTS -->
        <!-- When a key on the keyboard is pressed, your browser fires a "keydown" event. When it is released, you get a "keyup" event. -->

        <p>This page turns violet when you hold the V key.</p> 

        <script>
            window.addEventListener("keydown", event => { 
                if (event.key == "v") {
                    document.body.style.background = "violet"; 
                } else if
                    (event.key == "b") {
                    document.body.style.background = "skyblue"; 
                }
            });
            window.addEventListener("keyup", event => { 
                if (event.key == "v") {
                    document.body.style.background = ""; 
                } else if
                    (event.key == "b") {
                    document.body.style.background = ""; 
                }
            });
        </script>

        <!-- The example looked at the key property of the event object to see which key the event is about. -->
        <!-- This property holds a string that, for most keys, corresponds to the thing that pressing that key would type. -->
        <!-- For special keys such as ENTER, it holds a string that names the key ("Enter", in this case). -->
        <!-- shiftKey, ctrlKey, altKey, and metaKey properties of keyboard and mouse events can be used when looking for key combinations -->
