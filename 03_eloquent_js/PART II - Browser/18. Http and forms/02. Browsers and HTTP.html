        - A moderately complicated website can easily include anywhere from 10 to 200 resources. 
        - To be able to fetch those quickly, browsers will make several GET requests simultaneously, rather than waiting for the responses one at a time.
        - When the <form> elementâ€™s method attribute is "GET" (or is omitted), the information in the form is added to the end of the action URL as a query string.

        -> GET /example/message.html?name=Jean&message=Yes%3F HTTP/1.1              <!-- GET method adds the content of the form as query string to the end of the request action URL -->

        - The question mark(?) indicates the end of the path part of the URL and the start of the query.
        - It is followed by pairs of names and values, corresponding to the name attribute on the form field elements and the content 
          of those elements, respectively.
        - An ampersand character (&) is used to separate the pairs.

        <form method="GET" action="example/message.html"> 
            <p>Name: <input type="text" name="name"></p> 
            <p>Message:<br><textarea name="message"></textarea></p> 
            <p><button type="submit">Send</button></p>
        </form>

        - Some characters in query strings must be escaped. The quesion mark represented by %3F is one of those.
        - JavaScript provides the "encodeURIComponent" and "decodeURIComponent" functions to encode and decode this format.

        console.log(encodeURIComponent("Yes?")); 
        console.log(decodeURIComponent("Yes%3F"));

        - If we change the method attribute of the HTML form to POST, the HTTP will use the POST method and put the query string in the body of the request

        -> POST /example/message.html HTTP/1.1 
        -> Content-length: 24 
        -> Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        -> name=Jean&message=Yes%3F                                                  <!-- With POST method, the query string is added to the body of the request -->



        - GET requests should be used for requests that do not have side effects but simply ask for information. 
        - Requests that change something on the server, for example creating a new account or posting a message, should be expressed with other methods, such as POST.
