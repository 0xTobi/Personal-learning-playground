//  There are several ways to take data (a string of code) and run it as part of the current program.

//  - The most obvious way is the special operator eval, which will execute a string in the current scope. 
//  - This is usually a bad idea because it breaks some of the properties that scopes normally have, such as it being easily 
//    predictable which binding a given name refers to.
const x = 1; 
function evalAndReturnX(code) { 
    eval(code); 
    return x;
}
console.log(evalAndReturnX("var x = 2"));
console.log(x);


//  - A less scary way of interpreting data as code is to use the --Function constructor--.
//  - It takes two arguments: a string containing a comma-separated list of argument names and a string containing the function body. 
//  - It wraps the code in a function value so that it gets its own scope and wonâ€™t do odd things with other scopes.
let plusOne = Function("n", "return 1 + n;")
console.log(plusOne(4))

let sumTwoDigits = Function("n", "a", "return n + a;")
console.log(sumTwoDigits(2, 5))
